# Getting-and-cleaning-data

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and the work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code required to perform the analyses in the assignment.
